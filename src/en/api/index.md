# Kodex API

Kodex provides a REST API that can be used to define and manage actions, stream configurations, data sources and destinations as well as transform data.
To get started please first read the section on [authentication]({{'api.authentication'|href}}), which explains how to access the API and how the role-based access management works.
Detailed information about the API endpoints can then be found in the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/kiprotect/kodex/blob/master/api/openapi.yaml).
